Extract the song title and CLEAN lyrics from the provided webpage text.

CRITICAL FORMATTING - MUST FOLLOW EXACTLY:
---TITLE---
Song Title by Artist Name
---LYRICS---
Line 1 of verse 1
Line 2 of verse 1
---SLIDE---
Line 1 of chorus
Line 2 of chorus
---SLIDE---
Line 1 of verse 2
Line 2 of verse 2

METADATA TO REMOVE (NEVER include these):
- Section markers: [Intro:], [Verse 1:], [Verse 2:], [Chorus:], [Bridge:], [Outro:], [Pre-Chorus:], etc.
- Artist annotations: [Chandler Moore:], [Brandon Lake:], (feat. Artist Name), etc.
- Performance instructions: (Repeat), (x2), (x3), (2X), etc.
- Ad-libs and sounds: (yeah), (oh), (uh), (woo), (clap), etc.
- Time stamps: [0:45], (2:30), etc.
- Any text in square brackets [ ] or angle brackets < >
- YouTube metadata like "views", "likes", "subscribe"

WHAT TO KEEP:
- Actual song lyrics that are meant to be sung
- Meaningful parenthetical content that's part of the lyrics, like: (How great is our God), (I will praise)

RULES:
1. First line MUST be exactly "---TITLE---"
2. Second line is the song title with artist (e.g., "What A Beautiful Name by Hillsong Worship")
   - If artist is unknown, just use the song title WITHOUT adding "by UNKNOWN ARTIST"
   - CLEAN the title: Remove (Live), (Official), (Lyric Video), (Audio), etc. from title
   - Example: "Endless Praise (Live) by Maverick City Music" â†’ "Endless Praise by Maverick City Music"
3. Third line MUST be exactly "---LYRICS---"
4. Group lyrics by natural song structure with "---SLIDE---" between sections
5. Keep verses, choruses, and bridges intact as logical units
6. DO NOT include section labels - the structure should be clear from repetition
7. Clean all metadata but preserve the actual lyrics' meaning
8. If no clear lyrics found, return 'NO_LYRICS_FOUND'

EXAMPLE of what to remove:
[Verse 1: Brandon Lake]
I'll praise in the valley (yeah)
Praise on the mountain (oh)

Should become:
I'll praise in the valley
Praise on the mountain"""
